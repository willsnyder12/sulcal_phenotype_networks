Alternate sulci images, here with ascending portions of the superior temporal sulcus included with the rest of the superior temporal sulcus labeled by BrainVISA. 
With some photoshop, you can adapt sulcal image files for whatever sulcal parcellation you use -- this just happens to be another parcellation 
I like to get more coverage around the temporal parietal occipital junction.
