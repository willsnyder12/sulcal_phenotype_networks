Code to generate and interpret SPNs and compare them to fetal sulcation milestones is in `SPN_analysis.Rmd`. This R-Markdown file is knitted into a readable format in `SPN_analysis_markdown.pdf`.
To run the code, note that you must have the folder spn_analysis in your ~/Downloads directory. Additionally provided are sulcal phenotypes for 25 random subjects, which are analyzed in addition to the full group mean SPN data in the R code walkthrough. Also, supplementary tables are provided again that are accessed in the R code.
