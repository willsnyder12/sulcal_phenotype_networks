Left hemisphere sulcal parcellations are provided in the FreeSurfer *.annot format. The parcellations were designed to have each region labeled with the center of the label being the sulcal fundus and the boundaries being at gyral peaks, such that data within the sulcus (defined as sulcal banks + fundus between gyral peaks) could be analyzed. This is shown in the adult sulcal parcellation below. Additionally, the spatiotemporal fit of the fetal sulcal parcellations can be viewed at https://youtu.be/fmQ3TEMDU1o and https://youtu.be/lcGRXZTy5lc .
